# Overview

This is the Chroma RGB Mod server for RUST. This allows a RUST client to control Chroma RGB lighting on Windows. The server runs a mod and a client app (on Windows) handles displaying the lighting.

You can find the Chroma RGB Mod client for RUST [here](https://github.com/tgraupmann/Cpp_RustChromaModClient).
